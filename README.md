## Technologies

The technologies used in this design are:

* HTML & CSS & Ts
* Tailwind
* Angular

## Note  

An API has been integrated into the app to display different advice. Angular Pwa has been included to play the sound of dice while clicking the dice button. Maybe angular not needed but it is just for practice purposes.

```sh  
git clone https://github.com/Zakaria9375/fm-advice-generator.git
